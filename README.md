# Word2Vec
This Python project utilizes the Word2Vec model from Gensim to explore word embeddings and perform word analogies. It loads a pre-trained Word2Vec model, demonstrates word similarity, and implements an analogy function to find related words.

Key Features:

Loading pre-trained Word2Vec model (word2vec-google-news-300).
Exploring word embeddings and similarity.
Implementing a word analogy function.
Demonstrating word relationships (e.g., "king - man + woman = queen").
Technologies:

Gensim, NumPy, Matplotlib (for visualization, if extended).
Use Case:

Exploring word embeddings and semantic relationships using Word2Vec.
